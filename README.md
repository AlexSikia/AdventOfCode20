# AdventOfCode20

My solutions to the Advent Of Code 2020 problems.

Each Day is solved in a separate folder.

Solutions are implemented in different languages, and using different frameworks, based solely on my desire to work with specific tools any given day.

Notes:
- Scala solutions using SBT (those with a `build.sbt` file) can be run using `sbt run` from the base folder of the day, and the tests with `sbt test`.
- Scala solutions that do not use SBT should just be run by typing `scala <file.scala>`
- Node.js solutions can be run using `node <file.js>`
